# Ai_verge_blog-post-scraping
Using Node.js to scrape all  posts on verge about AI.

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment for Javascript, 
but it also has some powerful librabry for web scraping.
In this project I will be scraping all post about AI on The verge with Axios and Cheerio.

Axios will send the requests while cheerio will parse this HTML and locate the require fields.
